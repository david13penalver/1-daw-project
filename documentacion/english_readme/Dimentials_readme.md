# 0. What is Dimentials? 

Dimentials is a multidisciplinary project that revolutionizes the world of merchandising and games through a unique collection of creatures originating from multidimensional portals. These creatures, grouped by their dimension of origin, share physical characteristics that make them unique and recognizable, ranging from Jurassic environments to realms made entirely of sweets. Inspired by the visual style and creative richness of iconic franchises like Pokémon, Digimon, and Yu-Gi-Oh, Dimentials offers both a fresh and familiar experience.

The Dimentials website serves as a window to the universe of these extraordinary creatures, promoting not only their discovery but also the acquisition of the innovative collectible card game "Dimentials Calamity Conquest". This first trading game invites players to dive into strategic battles and collecting, marking the beginning of an unprecedented adventure in the realm of card games.
